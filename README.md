# fastapi-task-manger-service
Thatâ€™s a great goal! FastAPI is an excellent framework for building APIs quickly and efficientlyâ€”perfect for a future GenAI-powered chat service.

  

To help you learn FastAPI effectively, I recommend starting with a **real-world beginner-to-intermediate project** that covers key concepts like routing, models, database integration, and authentication. Hereâ€™s a suggested learning path with a project:

---

### **âœ… Suggested Learning Project:**Â 

### **Task Manager API**

  

#### **ðŸ§  Why This Project?**

- Covers CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    
- Introduces FastAPI routing, request/response models, validation
    
- Uses databases (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM)
    
- Teaches user authentication (JWT or OAuth2)
    
- Easy to extend later (e.g., chat-related tasks, reminders, AI tagging)

### **ðŸ›  Project Features**

1. **User Registration & Login**
    
    - Secure password hashing
        
    - JWT-based login authentication
        
    
2. **Task CRUD API**
    
    - Create a new task
        
    - List all tasks for a user
        
    - Update task title, description, status
        
    - Delete a task
        
    
3. **Optional Enhancements**
    
    - Add tags to tasks
        
    - Set deadlines and reminders
        
    - Search and filter tasks
        
    - Simple frontend with Bootstrap + HTMX or React
        
    

---

### **ðŸ§© Technologies Youâ€™ll Learn**

- FastAPI basics (routes, query/path/body params)
    
- Pydantic (data validation)
    
- SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM
    
- Alembic (for DB migrations)
    
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)
    
- FastAPI security utilities (OAuth2PasswordBearer, etc.)

Once youâ€™re comfortable with this project, we can expand it into a **chat service** using:

- WebSockets (FastAPI supports it)
    
- Redis Pub/Sub (for real-time message passing)
    
- Background tasks (for async AI processing)
    
- Integration with OpenAI or AWS Bedrock (for GenAI)
    

  

Would you like me to scaffold the project structure for your Task Manager API?
